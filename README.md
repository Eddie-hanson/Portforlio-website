# Portfolio Website


A simple, responsive portfolio website built with Django to refresh and test my skills. This project showcases my personal work, includes a contact form, and displays projects in a gallery layout.

## Project Overview

This portfolio was created as part of a Django refresher course, since it’s been a while since I last worked with Django. The goal was to rebuild confidence in backend development while combining it with frontend skills to create a complete full-stack application.

### Tech Stack
	•	Backend: Python, Django
	•	Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### Key Features
	•	Responsive Design – Looks great on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
	•	Contact Form – Allows visitors to reach out easily.
