Hello! I’m Edward Koffi Hanson, a 23-year-old technology enthusiast and aspiring <strong>Software Engineer</strong> , currently studying <strong>Information Technology</strong> at the <strong>University of Ghana, Department of Computer Science</strong>. I am passionate about building innovative software solutions that can 
transform how we interact with the world, with a particular interest in intelligent systems and autonomous technology.

<br> <br>My journey into tech began with a deep curiosity about how digital systems work. Over the years, I’ve developed proficiency in programming languages like <strong>Java</strong>  and <strong>Python</strong> , and built a strong foundation in backend development, 
software architecture, and problem-solving. I thrive on challenges and am always exploring new ways to apply software engineering to complex, real-world problems.

<br> <br>One of my most exciting aspirations is to contribute to <strong>Project DragonFly</strong> , an initiative by Airbus aimed at enabling autonomous flight through advanced sensing and decision-making technologies. I am especially drawn
 to the role of <strong>computer vision</strong> in this field—how it allows machines to perceive and interpret their environment, improving safety and efficiency in 
aviation. My goal is to apply my growing skills in this area to help shape the future of smart, 
self-piloting aircraft systems.

<br> <br>Beyond my academic work, I’m dedicated to continuous learning and pushing the boundaries of my technical knowledge. I plan to pursue a <strong>PhD</strong> in
 <strong>Software Engineering</strong>, with a focus on <strong>intelligent systems, computer vision, and autonomous platforms</strong>.
 I’m also committed to using my skills to solve challenges in underserved communities, particularly through open-source 
collaborations and mentoring initiatives in tech education.

<br> <br>I believe in using technology as a force for good—whether it’s automating aircraft, optimizing systems, or simply helping someone write their first line of code. If you’re interested in collaborating, discussing innovative ideas, or working on impactful projects😊😊, <strong> I’d love to connect😁😁😁.</strong>
